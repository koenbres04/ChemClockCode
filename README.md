# ChemClockCode

The code for a modelling task at the university of Leiden on oscilating chemical reactions.

## contents

- `plots.ipynb`: A jupyter notebook containg the code generating the figures illustrating the base model.
- `spatial_chem_sim.py`: Some more general code for simulating a chemical reaction reaction with diffusion.
- `final_simulation.py`: The code for the simulation described in the Simulation section.
- `output_processing.py`: Some code for reading the output of `final_simulation.py` and generating the plots in the Results section from them.
